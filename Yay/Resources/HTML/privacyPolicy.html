Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</span></p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Information Shared with Other Users. When you register as a user of Friendzi, your Friendzi proﬁle will be viewable by other users of the Service. Other users will be able to view information you have provided to us directly or through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, such as your Facebook photos, any additional photos you upload, your ﬁrst name, your age, approximate number of miles away, your personal description, and information you have in common with the person viewing your proﬁle, such as common Facebook, Twitter and Instagram  friends and likes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

We may share personal information with:</span></p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Service providers: We may share information, including personal and ﬁnancial information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulﬁlling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our Service functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Service. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Other Situations</b></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">We may disclose your information, including personal information:</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Aggregated and/or non-personal information. We may use and share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reﬂect de-identiﬁed demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Do Not Track Disclosure</b></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide the opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals, as the Internet industry works toward deﬁning exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Third Party Websites</b></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">There are a number of places on our Service where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third- party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>How you can access your information</b></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">If you have a Friendzi account, you have the ability to review and update your personal information within the Service by opening your account and going to settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. You also may close your account at any time by visiting the "Settings" page for your account. If you close your account, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Your choices about collection and use of your information</b></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Service because such information may be required in order for you to register as user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Our Service may also deliver notiﬁcations to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notiﬁcations by going into “Settings” on the app or by changing the settings on your mobile device.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">You can also control information collected by cookies. You can delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. Click “help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.</span></p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>How we protect your personal information</b></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Use of technologies to collect information. We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on our Service.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Information collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Cookies and Use of Cookie Data. When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you Friendzi advertisements on other sites or applications.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Pixel tags. We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Mobile Device IDs: If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identiﬁer assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in “Settings” on your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s2">Information collected by third-parties for advertising purposes. We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-anonymized personal information to third parties. Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see.</span></p>
